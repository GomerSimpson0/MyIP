#MyIP

Hello! This is a simple script which can help you to find out your localhost ip, ip address in local network and your global ip address

You need to install Python 3 and some packages, such as pymyip0 and bs4

Run command to install python packages in Windows:
	pip install -r depends.txt
Run command to install python packages in Linux:
	pip3 install -r depends.txt

After installing it should work

If you work in Linux you can make alias, for example: alias myip='python3 /path/to/script/main.py' to run script in one command

Pleasant use :)
